# Pwsh Matrix Animation

Matrix Animation in your Terminal (cross-platform in PowerShell). Written to be quite flexible, featuring:
- Cross-platform rendering systems (Switchable with `-Renderer [Windows, Unix]`)
  - Windows mode: Uses PowerShell's native console manipulation capabilities through `System.Management.Automation.Host` namespace. It utilizes `Place-BufferedContent` for precise character placement and supports Windows console color schemes.
  - Unix mode: Employs ANSI escape sequences for text positioning and coloring, providing compatibility with a wide range of Unix-based terminals. This mode offers more fine-grained color control, enabling smoother color transitions and a more vibrant "glow" effect for the leading characters.
- Adjustable sparsity of the matrix effect with `-Sparsity`
- Customizable animation speed with `-SleepTime`
- Option to use special characters for a more authentic Matrix look with `-SpecialChars` (works best with Unicode-compatible terminals)
- Debug mode for troubleshooting with `-Debug`
- Dynamic resizing to fit the terminal window

## Features

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows and Unix-based systems)
- Adjustable matrix density
- Customizable animation speed
- Special character mode for authentic Matrix appearance
- Dynamic resizing to fit terminal window
- Debug mode for troubleshooting

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or later (PowerShell Core 6.0+ recommended for cross-platform use)

## Usage

Run the script using PowerShell:

```powershell
Matrix.ps1 [[-Sparsity] <double>] [[-SleepTime] <int>] [[-Renderer] <string>] [-SpecialChars] [-Debug]
```

### Parameters
- `-Sparsity`: Density of the matrix effect (range: 0.0001 to 1, default: 0.1)
- `-SleepTime`: Animation speed in milliseconds (default: 50)
- `-Renderer`: Choose between "Windows" or "Unix" rendering (default: "Unix")
- `-SpecialChars`: Use special characters for a more authentic Matrix look
- `-Debug`: Enable debug mode for troubleshooting

### Examples

1. Run with default settings:
   ```powershell
   .\Matrix.ps1
   ```

2. Full feature demo:
   ```powershell
   .\Matrix.ps1 -SpecialChars -Sparsity 1 -Renderer Unix
   ```

3. Use Windows on old terminals (like `conhost`, `cmd`)
   ```powershell
   .\Matrix.ps1 -SleepTime 20 -Renderer Windows
   ```

### In case you've never setup powershell
- Run this: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` (Allows you to run powershell scripts)
- Cd to the path where you cloned this project
- Run `./Matrix.ps1`

## How It Works
The script creates a matrix-like animation by:
1. Generating random characters (including optional special characters)
2. Creating vertical lines of these characters
3. Animating the lines to fall down the screen
4. Adjusting colors to create a glowing effect

The animation adapts to the terminal window size and can handle window resizing.

## Known Issues
- Performance may vary depending on terminal and system specifications
- Some terminals may not support all color features
